**Gait Monitoring Website Visualization** is a data visualization tool that will assist in visualizing and understanding the current research project. 

##Summary Of Overall Project

For fall-risk assessment of older adults, long-term non-intrusive gait monitoring at home is crucial. Due to floor vibration-based system’s need for dense deployment, we propose to install structural vibration sensors on robot vacuum cleaners that would be able to collect data from around the house. In order to validate our system, we conduct experiments that compare signals acquired from sensors on floor and sensors on robot.
