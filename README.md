# Gait Monitoring WebApp Visualization Tool
# Pervasive Autonomous Networked Systems Lab
Submitted by: **Francisco Lira** and **Melody Hu**

**Gait Monitoring Website Visualization** is a data visualization tool that will assist in visualizing and understanding the current research project. 

## Summary Of Overall Project

For fall-risk assessment of older adults, long-term non-intrusive gait monitoring at home is crucial. Due to floor vibration-based system’s need for dense deployment, we propose to install structural vibration sensors on robot vacuum cleaners that would be able to collect data from around the house. In order to validate our system, we conduct experiments that compare signals acquired from sensors on floor and sensors on robot.

Time spent: Summer 2021 (June - August)


Each sensor node contains two parts: the signal amplifier, sampling part, and data collection and saving part. This tutorial introduces how to build the sensor unit from the independent modules to a functional sensor unit.

## Hardware modules information
Module information.
| Name | Type |Number | Link|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|Geophone | SM-24 |1| [sparkfun link](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11744) |
|Amplifier | SparkFun OpAmp Breakout - LMV358 |1| [sparkfun link](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9816) |
|Arduino | SparkFun SAMD21 Mini Breakout |1| [sparkfun link](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13664) |
|Rasbperry Pi| Raspberry Pi 3 B+ |1| [sparkfun link](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14643)

Besides these modules on the above table, you also need solder, an extend empty board to hold all the module, some suitable jump wire, some [headers](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/116), a Micro-usb wire.

## Hardware connection

This figure showed the connection between the Arduino, Geophone, and Amplifier. The red wire represents the 3.3V power supply. The black wire represents the GND. The blue and green wires represent the signal from the Geophone, one connects to the GND, and the other one as the input of the Amplifier module. The yellow wire represents the output of the Amplifier and as the input of the Adruino board ADC pin.

Using the Micro-USB wire to connect the Arduino board and the Raspberry Pi. That's all the soldering and connection work.

## Software deployment

### Visualization tool Setup
The repository of the visulaization code can be found [here](https://github.com/frankie-lira/Gait-Monitoring-Website)

Run the code in your IDE of choosing (Recommend Visual Studio Code) and make sure that it runs locally. 

### Arduino 
The setup guide for Arduino Zero can be found [here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/samd21-minidev-breakout-hookup-guide/setting-up-arduino)

To flush the code, you need to install the Arduino Zero from board manager. Then follow the guidance [here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/samd21-minidev-breakout-hookup-guide/setting-up-arduino). Make sure select SparkFun SAMD21 Mini Breakout as the board when flush.

The code that was flushed to the arduino can be found [here](https://github.com/frankie-lira/Gait-Monitoring-Website/tree/master/Arduino)

### Raspberry Pi

#### Raspberry Pi setup
First of all, download SD card installation file: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/

Unzip the file and put the files into the SD card formatted as FAT32 Find wired mouse, keyboard, HDMI cable, ethernet cable, and a screen before you start. Refer to https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/noobs-install/elcapitan/ and https://github.com/dandanpan/multi-people-tracking

for the rest of the installation.

When ask for ”Enter interface name”, enter wlan0 to setup the wireless network settings

Furthermore, setup the static IP address for the node for easy access: https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/networking-lessons/rpi-static-ip-address/

Enable SSH on the Pi by following this: https://pihw.wordpress.com/guides/direct-network-connection/

#### Raspberry Pi Server Set Up
in the build in python IDE in the Raspberry pi write the code for the server. The code that was sued to create the server can be found [here](https://github.com/frankie-lira/Gait-Monitoring-Website/tree/master/raspberry%20pi)
